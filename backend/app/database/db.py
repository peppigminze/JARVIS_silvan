SQLAlchemy engine / session setup.

V1 deliberately uses the *synchronous* SQLAlchemy API with SQLite.
This keeps the code simple and predictable (see project rule:
no over-engineering in V1). SQLite + sync sessions are more than
enough for a single-user local-first assistant.

    the way DML does). This is safe ONLY because every call site is a
