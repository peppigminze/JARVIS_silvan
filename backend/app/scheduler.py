"""
Reminder scheduler (project spec section 12).

Runs as a background asyncio task inside the FastAPI process (started
from the lifespan in app/main.py). Every SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_SECONDS it
looks for tasks whose due_at has passed and that haven't fired yet for
this occurrence, marks them notified (so the PWA can show a
notification via GET /api/tasks/due-reminders), and - if recurring -
schedules the next occurrence instead of the reminder just disappearing.

Being level-triggered (a plain "due_at <= now() AND not yet notified
for this occurrence" query) rather than an in-memory timer means
downtime is handled for free: if the backend was off when a reminder
was due, the very next tick after restart fires it immediately instead
of silently losing it ("PC startet -> Scheduler synchronisiert ->
verpasste Reminder werden korrekt behandelt", project spec section 12).
